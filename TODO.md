# TODO for Fixing Clustering and Classification Script

- [x] Fix incorrect assignment of clusters to X_train_sel and X_test_sel by using original indices from the train_test_split.
- [x] Ensure 'cluster' column is properly added to X_selected, X_train_sel, and X_test_sel.
- [x] Update the clustering section to correctly handle the split.
- [x] Encode the target variable 'tree_species' using LabelEncoder to handle categorical classes.
- [x] Test the script by running it to ensure no errors and models are saved.
